# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

# Rules for Python variables:

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.



myvar = "python"
my_var = "python"
_my_var = "python"
myVar  = "python"
MYVAR = "python"

print(myVar)
print(my_var)
print(_my_var)
print(myVar)
print(myvar)



# Illegal variable names:

# 1myvar = "python" 
# my-var = "python" 
# my var = "python"



# Multi Words Variable Names




# Camel Case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

# myVariableName = "John"

# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:

# MyVariableName = "John"

# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:

# my_variable_name = "John"
